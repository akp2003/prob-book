% In this file you should put the actual content of the blueprint.
% It will be used both by the web and the print version.
% It should *not* include the \begin{document}

% If you want to split the blueprint content into several files then
% the current file can be a simple sequence of \input. Otherwise It
% can start with a \section or \chapter for instance.

\input{chapters/ch1}
\input{chapters/ch2}
\input{chapters/ch3}
